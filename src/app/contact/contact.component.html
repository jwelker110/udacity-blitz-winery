                Erie-Freewater was founded in the mid-1800’s alongside what is now
                known as the Erie Canal River. This pristine river has its source 25
                miles southeast of Erie-Freewater in Washington’s beautiful Green
                Mountains. From there the river meanders through Sunnyville, traversing
                southeastern Washington and finally merging with the mighty Columbia.
